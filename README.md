# Arduino-Ultrasonic-LiDAR-Siumulation

This project simulates a 2D LiDAR system using SR04 ultrasonic sensors which is mounted on a servor motor These are controlled by an Arduino UNO (Elegoo R3). The system scans surroundings and sends distance and angle data over serial communication which is visualized with the SDL2 library

The inspiration for this project came from seeing real-world LiDAR systems, witch work in a similar (but more advanced) way
